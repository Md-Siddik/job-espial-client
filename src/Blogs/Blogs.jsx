                        <p className="mt-2"><span className="text-2xl font-bold">Access token :</span> In React, think of an access token like a special pass that your app gets after proving who it is. This pass is essential for accessing certain parts of a website or interacting with other online services. It is like a secret code that your app carries around, showing it is allowed to do specific things, like fetching data from a server or updating information. To get this pass, your app typically needs to go through a login process or some kind of authentication dance. Once your app has this access token, it can use it to prove its identity and do its job securely. <br />
                            <span className="text-2xl font-bold">How access token works : </span>Access tokens are like digital keys that prove your identity to access certain online resources, such as APIs or web services. You get them after logging into an app, and you include them with your requests to prove you are allowed to access what you are asking for. They expire after a while for security, but you can often get new ones without logging in again using something called a refresh token.<br /><br />z
                            <span className="text-2xl font-bold">Refresh token : </span>In React, a refresh token serves as a backup key that allows your app to keep accessing certain parts of a website or online services even after the original access token expires. Think of it as a spare key that your app holds onto securely. When the original access token gets close to expiring, your app can use this refresh token to quietly request a new access token without bothering the user for their credentials again. It is like a seamless way of keeping the session alive and ensuring smooth user experience without interruptions due to expired access tokens.<br />
                            <span className="text-2xl font-bold">How refresh token works : </span>Refresh tokens are like backup keys. When your access token expires, instead of logging in again, you use this backup key (the refresh token) to get a new access token without needing to re-enter your credentials. It is a way to keep your session alive and access resources seamlessly.

It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features and utilities. Express.js is known for its minimalistic and flexible design, allowing developers to create web servers and handle HTTP requests and responses easily.

                            With Express.js, developers can define routes to handle different URLs, manage middleware for request processing, set up error handling, and integrate with databases and other services. It is widely used in both small-scale projects and large-scale applications due to its simplicity, performance, and extensive ecosystem of plugins and middleware.

                            In essence, Express.js makes it easier to build server-side applications and APIs using JavaScript and Node.js. <br /><br />
